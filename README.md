Project Description:

This project encompasses a web application developed using modern web development technologies. Below are details about the project's features and technologies used:

Backend (Nest.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma):

- The backend portion was developed using Nest.js, ensuring the application's efficiency and scalability.
- PostgreSQL was used as the database, integrated with Prisma ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for simplified database operations.
- User passwords were securely stored in the database using encryption algorithms, enhancing user data security.
- For every successful login, a JSON Web Token (JWT) was generated to verify user identity.

Frontend (Next.js):

- The frontend was built with Next.js to provide a fast and user-friendly interface.
- Users can register, log in, and log out with ease using user-friendly interfaces.
- Users can view blog posts created by other users and add new posts.
- Users can establish sessions with JWT tokens generated by the backend to maintain their sessions and ensure authorization.

The primary objective of this project is to enable users to register securely, create blog posts, and view other users' posts. Furthermore, the project incorporates robust security measures to safeguard user data and ensure the security of login processes.
